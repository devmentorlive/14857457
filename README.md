# ReactJS Based RPG Game! (part 3) [Map Builder, Selectable Tileset, Background Layer]

Today we continue our map maker. By the end of the screencast, we will be able to select the tileset our map uses, including variants (spring, fall, winter), we will have a base layer to allow our transparent sprites to sit on top of the correct background, and I will show you how to collapse numerous calls to useState into a single state tree (similar to redux without all the broiler-plate).

This project uses sprites from:
