# Build a RPG Map Editor in React (part 2) [hooks, copy/paste, json]

Today we will build enough of the map maker tool to start using it in our game! I will show you how to copy and paste your clipboard programmatically using JavaScript's navigator object, how to do conditional rendering, and of course, lots more practice with useState and useEffect. Also, I will teach you why it is easier to keep state together that changes together instead of breaking it all up into multiple useState calls..

This repository contains the code that I based an episode of DevmentorLive on. You can find the episode at: [Build a RPG Map Editor in React (part 1) [Drag n Drop, Matrices, useState])](https://devmentor.live/screencasts/build-a-rpg-map-editor-in-react-part-2-hooks-copy-paste-json)
